# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

This project was completed by Candice Shu Zhou here in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In
particular, I have:

Project Description

Uber fundementally changed the way we think about for-hire rides. I am interested in exploring the trend of 
Uber pickups in NYC, specifically when and where do the rides take place, from which I believe we can 
draw some useful conclusions on people's communting habits in the city. I am also curious about the total 
number of Ubers in comparison to number of Yellow Cabs in NYC - do we have more cabs or taxis - so this 
project will also compare the number of Uber and Yellow Cab pickups in a day by hours.

The project will explore these issues in several steps.

Data description and data source
Discuss the tools and packages, as well as key functions used to process the data
When do people demand the most Uber rides in one day? -- Interpret the data to analyze the trend in Uber pickups by hours in one day
On which day in a week do people demand more Uber rides? -- Interpret the data to analyze the trend in Uber pickups by weekdays in one week
Where are the pickups? -- Map the Uber pickup location in NYC
Compare Uber vs. Yellow Cab pickups in June 2014

This project is inspired by FiveThirtyEight's extensive analysis of Uber and its impact on NYC traffic.
